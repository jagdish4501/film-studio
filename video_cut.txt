The `write_videofile` operation can indeed be resource-intensive, especially for larger videos or higher resolutions. To improve the speed and efficiency of the video encoding process, you can consider the following optimizations:

1. **Use a Different Codec**: The `libx264` codec is a good choice for high-quality compression, but it might be slower. If speed is a primary concern, you could try using a different codec that is optimized for speed, such as `libx265`. Keep in mind that this might result in slightly larger file sizes.

   ```python
   final_clip.write_videofile(output_path, codec='libx265')
   ```

2. **Lower the Resolution**: If your input video is high-resolution, consider resizing it to a lower resolution before saving. This can significantly reduce encoding time.

   ```python
   resized_clip.write_videofile(output_path, codec='libx264')
   ```

3. **Use a Faster Preset**: Some codecs, like `libx264` and `libx265`, offer various presets for encoding speed and quality. You can try using a faster preset, such as `ultrafast`, to speed up the encoding process. However, this may result in slightly lower video quality.

   ```python
   final_clip.write_videofile(output_path, codec='libx264', preset='ultrafast')
   ```

4. **Use Hardware Acceleration**: If your system supports hardware acceleration (e.g., NVIDIA GPU for CUDA or Intel Quick Sync), you can leverage it to speed up encoding. Specify the appropriate `hwaccel` parameter and codec options for hardware acceleration.

   ```python
   final_clip.write_videofile(output_path, codec='libx264', hwaccel='cuda')
   ```

5. **Parallel Processing**: If you have multiple cores or threads available, you can use the `threads` parameter to specify the number of threads to use for encoding. This can help speed up the process, especially for multi-core CPUs.

   ```python
   final_clip.write_videofile(output_path, codec='libx264', threads=4)
   ```

6. **External Encoding**: If speed is critical, consider using an external video encoding tool like `ffmpeg` directly. You can use the `subprocess` module to run the encoding command, giving you more control over the encoding parameters.

Remember that these optimizations might involve trade-offs between encoding speed and video quality. You should test different approaches with your specific use case to find the best balance for your needs.
